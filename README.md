# stm32f0_ARM
Cortex-M0 projects

The repo contains the complete set of sources and documentations
which are enough to start working with the chip installed into
STM32F0 Discovery. The repo structure is the following:

1) STM32F051R8T6 - legacy code, there are dozens of sources I wrote
having been a Windows user (yes, it is gross, because it is not pure and there
are a lot of strange files with weird extensions, but let it be as is)
2) doc - documentation
3) TemplateProject - the new and the purest project ever, feel free to use it
as a ground for your project

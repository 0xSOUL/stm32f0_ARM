Introduction to embedded programming on STM32
=============================================

STM32 is a modern family of MCUs produced by STMicroelectronics that is widely
used in research, consumer and industrial electronics. STM32 microcontrollers
are quite powerful and cheap, but impose initial barriers to get started
quickly.

The purpose of the course is to overcome these barries and steadily get into
the topic. This course will help to develop basic understanding of Cortex-M0
core and STM32F0 peripherals.
